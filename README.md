# Project Instructions

The goal of this project is to give you practice with:

- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls

On top of that, I want to introduce you to the topic of Natural Language Processing. NLPs leverage machine learning and deep learning create a program that can interpret natural human speech. Systems like Alexa, Google Assistant, and many voice interaction programs are well known to us, but understanding human speech is an incredibly difficult task and requires a lot of resources to achieve. Full disclosure, this is the Wikipedia definition, but I found it to be a clear one:

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence
> concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to
> process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

You could spend years and get a masters degree focusing on the details of creating NLP systems and algorithms. Typically, NLP programs require far more resources than individuals have access to, but a fairly new API called Aylien has put a public facing API in front of their NLP system. We will use it in this project to determine various attributes of an article or blog post.

## Getting started

`cd` into your new folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

or prefer Yarn âœ¨

```bash
yarn install
```

Client app in Development mode, will running on http://localhost:3001 (Webpack port config):

```bash
yarn dev
```

Run Server app:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Now Server app is running on http://localhost:8000

Production build:

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

Excute project test with following command:

```bash
yarn test
```

That it's!

## Setting up the API

Using the [MeaningCloud](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/sentiment-analysis) Sentiment Analysis API

## Deploying

A great step to take with your finished project would be to deploy it! Unfortunately its a bit out of scope for me to explain too much about how to do that here, but checkout [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for some really intuitive free hosting options.
